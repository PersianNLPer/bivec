This is a modified version of [bivec](http://stanford.edu/~lmthang/bivec/).
In this repository I try to put the minimal required files for creating cross-lingual word embeddings, and some easy-to-use scripts for running the experiments.
For more detailed information about the implementation and usage of the code you can refere to http://stanford.edu/~lmthang/bivec/.
